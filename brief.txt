Here's the 2022 survey:

ALWA are about to produce another one and publish it 31 Aug 2024. 

I was thinking for the visualisation it would be good to show what market is for current parental leave benefits.  And also to then show how the market has shifted from 2022 to 2024. 

I started putting some data down for 2022 (attached) which is summarised from the data in the link (a bit tricky to decide how to capture all of the detail) and then my plan was to also do those same fields for 2024 but open to any of your thoughts on how to do this.
