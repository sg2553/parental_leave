>ALWA are about to produce another one and publish it 31 Aug 2024.

>I was thinking for the visualisation it would be good to show what market is for current parental leave benefits.  And also to then show how the market has shifted from 2022 to 2024.

>I started putting some data down for 2022 (attached) which is summarised from the data in the link (a bit tricky to decide how to capture all of the detail) and then my plan was to also do those same fields for 2024 but open to any of your thoughts on how to do this. 

## Files in this repository and used for the analysis

Data was manually taken from the AWLA parental leave survey data in 2022 and 2024 and broken down by leave period and clawback periods for both primary and secondary caregivers. Associate files: 

* AWLA-PARENTAL-LEAVE-SURVEY-RESULTS.pdf - Original file downloaded from AWLA website (raw data)
    * This pdf file has more lengthy descriptions of the leave policies for the different law firms.
* parental leave data.xlsx - curated data 
    * The combined table has the survey results broken down into the actual leave and clawback periods.
